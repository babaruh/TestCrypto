# CryptoInfoWPFApp

This is a WPF MVVM application that displays cryptocurrency information using the CoinGecko API. The application has a navigation system with four pages: Explore, Exchanges, Support, and CoinFullDataView.

## Explore

The Explore page contains a DataGrid that displays information about various cryptocurrencies. A double click on a cryptocurrency will open the CoinFullDataView page and show detailed information about the selected cryptocurrency.

## Exchanges

The Exchanges page contains a DataGrid that displays information about various cryptocurrency exchanges. A double click on an exchange will open a tab in your browser with the selected exchange's website.

## Support

The Support page contains links to the GitHub repository, a knowledge base, and an email address for support.

## CoinFullDataView

The CoinFullDataView page displays detailed information about a selected cryptocurrency, including a DataGrid that displays ticker information. The ticker information includes a link column, which opens the linked website when clicked.
